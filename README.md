Multiplayer game with one human player against an AI opponent. This is a project that I worked on that utilizes multiple AI game algorithms 
(Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning).

Rules: input coordinates of which spot to black out. When a spot is selected all adjacent spots are blacked out as well.
The player who can no longer make a move is the loser.
